\title{PBSawatea -- Tools for Running Awatea and Visualizing the Results}

\description{
  \pkg{PBSawatea} contains R code to control the input to and output from the 
  modelling of rockfish populations (e.g., Pacific Ocean Perch, \emph{Sebastes alutus})
  that occur along the British Columbia (BC) coast.

  The model implementation uses a modified version of the Coleraine statistical catch-at-age
  software (Hilborn \emph{et al.} 2003) called Awatea (Allan Hicks, IPHC, pers. comm.).
  Awatea template code is compiled by Automatic Differentiation Model Builder
  (ADMB) software (Otter Research 1999) to a 64-bit binary called \sQuote{\code{awatea.exe}}.
  Running the binary file, which contains ADMB libraries, provides
  (a) maximum posterior density estimates using a function minimiser and automatic differentiation, and 
  (b) an approximation of the posterior distribution of the parameters using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
  method, specifically using the Hastings-Metropolis algorithm (Gelman et al. 2004).

  The running of Awatea is streamlined, using code written in R (R Development Core Team 2018)
  rather than manually manipulating the original Microsoft Excel implementation.
  Figures and tables of output are automatically produced through R using code adapted
  from the R packages \pkg{scape} (Magnusson 2009) and \pkg{plotMCMC} (Magnusson & Stewart 2007).
  We use the R function \code{Sweave} (Leisch 2008) in the package \pkg{utils} to 
  automatically collate, via LaTeX (specifically pdflatex), the large amount of figures
  and tables into a single portable document file (\code{.pdf}) for each model run.
  
  We  provide master \code{Sweave} files in the folder \code{../library/PBSawatea/snw}
  to build the \code{.pdf} document. The code copies these to a local working directory 
  if they are not already there.\cr
