1.5.0 (2019-05-31) [Rcheck=T, Rbuild=T]
  * PBSscape.r
    + Assigned `quants3', `quants5', and `boxpars' to the .PBSmodEnv rather than making them global. (RH 190531)
      - Changed plotting functions relying on these objects to use `tcall' instead of `get'.
    + Added a global assigns for `outline' and `boxpars' for the calls to `quantbox' in building pdf docs for MCMC runs.
    + Added a few small tweaks to function `plt.mpdGraphs' (RH 190509)
      - Skip calling plot functions for ages if all fits are equal to zero.
      - Changed data passed to `plotACFs' from `currentMCMC' to `mcmcObj$P'.
      - Changed call to `plotChains' to `panelChains'.
    + Removed function `findTarget' and moved it to `utilFuns.r'.
  * plotFuns.r
    + Repeated `myboxplot.stats' and `qboxplot' in `zzz.r' (for package building) and `plotFuns.r' for running local code only. (RH 190531)
    + Added new function `panelBoxes' to plot quantile plots using `nchains' to delimit separate boxes. (RH 190521)
    + Revised function `mochaLatte' to be more flexible with arguments and to accomodate quantile box limits. (RH 190521)
    + Renamed function `plotChains' to `panelChains' to be consistent with other functions using `mochaLatte'. (RH 190509)
    + Created new function `panelTraces' for comparing parameter traces in `Model Results' appendix. (RH 190509)
    + Revised function `plotACFS' to take paramater MCMCs directly rather than extracting them from a general MCMC object. (RH 190509)
    + Revised function `plotAges' to skip plotting age fits if fits are all zero. (RH 190507)
    + Recreated PBStools' function `quantBox' as `quantbox' to continue reliance only on PBSmodelling. (RH 180403)
      - Note that some PBStools functions may have creeped into the PBSawatea because RH is the only person using PBSawatea.
      - The function `plotBox' has been deprecated in favour of `quantbox' but still exists for a transition period.
    + Revised function `plotCPUE' to remove condtion `all(cvpro==FALSE)' because sometimes (e.g. WWR) all cvpro are zero. (RH 190507)
    + Ditto for function `plotIndexNotLattice' re: cvpro check for logicals (cvpro can only be numeric now). (RH 190509)
    + Revised function `plotSnail' to get UoverUmsy after is has been combined (averaged) across gear types. (RH 190509)
    + Revised function `plotTraj' to deal with 12 WWR sensitivities -- colours, line types, etc. (RH 190516)
    + Revised functions `plt.ageResidsPOP', `plt.cohortResids', `plt.yearResidsPOP' to use `quantbox' rather than `boxplot' (RH 190509)
      - Gag me with a spoon Heather.
      - Also turned the outliers back on (AME had turned them off).
    + Added new function `splineCPUE' to fit spline curves through CPUE data to determine CV process error. (RH 190103)
  * runADMB.r
    + Changed method of reweighting in function `runADMB' and method `setMethod.reweight'. (RH 190404)
      - Previously, choices were based on values (mixed logical|numeric) of `cvpro' and `mean.age'.
      - New method uses vectors of method type for abundance (A.reweight) and composition (C.reweight) with length `N.reweight'.
      - Allows for independent reweighting of CVs for abundance and AF SS (sample size) for composition.
      - Also allows the user to choose which reweighting gets which method (mix and|or match).
      - PJS suggested this for WWR 2019 based on work by Alistair Dunn (NZ ling on Chatham Rise).
  * runSweaveMCMC.r
    + Made small tweaks like checking if `log_qCPUE' was estimated when Ncpue=0. (RH 190425)
  * utilFuns.r
    + Added new function `combGear' to combine values by year from multiple gear types. (RH 190501)
      - e.g., add biomass values, calculate geometric mean of exploitation rates.
    + Moved function `findTarget' from `PBSscape.r' to this `utilFuns.r'.
    + Added new function `getNpan' to get panel number when inside a multi-panel plot. (RH 190501)
  * run-master.Snw
    + Added calls to `save' for `currentRes' and `currentPar'. (RH 190508)
    + Changed figure caption for residual plots to reflect the use of quantile plots over boxplots. (RH 190508)
    + Made other small tweaks to figure captions for consistency.
  * run-masteMCMC.Snw
    + Added the MPD values to `currentMCMC' for use in Appendix F. (RH 190503)
      - currentMCMC$mpd = list(mpd.P=mpd.P, mpd.B=mpd.B, mpd.R=mpd.R)
    + Gather Ucurr earlier in the code; create `prevYear' to index Ucurr.
    + Added `UcurrGM.MCMC' (GM=geometric mean) as a target for `findTarget' when generating reference points.
    + Rearranged order of decision tables -- Bt>LRP, Bt>USR, Bt>Bmsy, ut<umsy, Bt>Bcurr, ut<ucurr, Bt>0.2B0, Bt>0.4B0

1.4.3 (2019-01-07) [Rcheck=F, Rbuild=F]
  * PBSscape.r
    + Changed renaming of output figure files in language loop. (RH 190107)
      - Now use `switch' (as in PBStools) instead of conditional `if'.
    + Changed CA-fit output from specifying number of years on a page to specifying number pages a priori and calculating yrs/page. (RH 181218)
  * plotFuns.r
    + Changed renaming of output figure files in language loop (see PBSscape). (RH 190107)
    + Keep track of `runNo' and rwtNo' in global list object `PBSawatea' to know when a plot is calculating an un-weighted index (rwt=0) (RH 181231).
  * runSweave.r
    + Added new argument `maxcol'; pass `maxcol' and `NCAset' to `run-master.Snw' (RH 181231)
    + Pass `runNo' and `rwtNo' to global list object `PBSawatea'. (RH 181231)
  * runSweaveMCMC.r
    + Pass `runNo' and `rwtNo' to global list object `PBSawatea'. (RH 181231)
  * Sweave
    + Revised `run-master.Snw' (RH 181231)
      - Added new variables `maxcol' and `NCAset' to be populated by function `runSweave'
    + Changed renaming of output figure files in language loop (see PBSscape). (RH 190107)
    + Fixed small bug (missing close brace for \Sexpr) in plotSnail figure caption. (RH 190107)

1.4.2 (2018-10-17) [Rcheck=T, Rbuild=F]
  * Documentation
    + Updated `README.md' file that appears for PBSawatea on GitHub. (RH 181017)
  * PBSscape.r
    + Added argument `op' to function `calc.refProbs', `calc.refProbsHist', and `findTarget'. (RH 181015)
      - To allow for P(B>Brfpt) and P(u<urfpt) or vice versa, where op = >|<.
      - Note that Forrest et al. use probability of being in bad place, where Haigh et al. use prob of being in a good place.
      - Rob Tadey (GMU) prefers the latter (glass-half-full kinda guy).
  * Sweave
    + Changed calls to `calc.refProbs', `calc.refProbsHist', and `findTarget' with new argument `op'. (RH 181015)

1.4.1 (2018-08-02) [Rcheck=F, Rbuild=F]
  * Sweave
    + Modified plot description for `plotChains' plot (RH 180802)
      - old: first segment (green), second segment (red) and final segment (blue)
      - new: first segment (red), second segment (blue) and final segment (black)
    + Fiddled with routine to get `createFdir' and `linguaFranca' from PBStools (package not required in PBSawatea). (RH 180730)
  * plotFuns.r
    + Debugged a small glith in `plotTraj'. (RH 180802)
    + Ensured that lattice-like plots generated by `mochaLatte' never have more rows than columns. (RH 180730)
    + Revised some calls to linguaFranca. (RH 180730)
    + Set the fourth element of `par(oma=c(w,x,y,z))' to 1 in most plots to ensure that xlab labels are not truncated on the right. (RH 180730)
  * PBSscape.r
    + Revised code in `plt.mpdGraphs' that plots selectivity. (RH 180730)
      - French plot was misinterpreting the maturity data because `scape::plotSel' looks for records marked `Maturity' to use as an ogive overlay marked `m'.
    + Reduced white space around figures `plotSel', `pdfBiomass', and `pdfRecruitment'. (RH 180730)
    + Ensured that the `splitChain' plot (via `mochaLatte') never has more rows than columns. (RH 180730)
  * Documentation
    + Updated the `R Documentation' PDF file called `PBSawatea.pdf' (RH 180726)
      - this is not a User's Guide.
    + Added the 2018 RSR (Redstripe Rockfish) data input files. (RH 180726)

1.4.0 (2018-07-26) [Rcheck=T, Rbuild=T]
  * PBSscape.r
    + Introduced new argument `lang' to produced figures in english and french. (RH 180710)
      - For functions that use a lang loop, argument lang=c("e","f"); otherwise lang="e".
      - Translation of english words and phrases is performed by the PBStools' function `linguaFranca'.
    + Moved all plotting functions other than `plt.mpdGraphs' and `plt.mcmcGraphs' to `plotFuns.r' (RH 180710)
      - Utility functions may be moved later to `utilFuns.r'.
  * plotFuns.r
    + Introduced new argument `lang' to produced figures in english and french. (RH 180710)
      - For functions that use a lang loop, argument lang=c("e","f"); otherwise lang="e".
    + Added all plotting functions other than `plt.mpdGraphs' and `plt.mcmcGraphs'. (RH 180710)
  * Sweave
    + Revised `run-master.Snw' & 'run-masterMCMC.Snw. (RH 180717)
      - Now uses the `lang' argument in function calls, primarily to `plt.mpdGraphs' and `plt.mcmcGraphs'
      - Simultaneoulsy creates english and french figures.
  * runSweave|runSweaveMCMC
    + Added new argument `lang' for the code to embed in the Sweave documents when processing for a model run. (RH 180712)

    + Updated Rd files to include a description of the `lang' argument when used. (RH 180726)

1.3.0 (2018-05-24)
  * Documentation
    + Added Rd files for new functions -- `mochaLatte', `plotACFs', `plotCI', `plotMeanAge', `plotTraj', and `tex.that.vec' (RH 180524)
      - Fixed existing Rd files with Codoc errors identified by R check.
  * PBSscape.r
    + Created function `flash.cat' to replace use of PBStools' `flush.cat' because PBSawatea does not depend on PBStools. (RH 180523)
    + Modified function `plotBVBnorm' to remove word `virgin' and to italicise parameters in legend. (RH 180516)
    + Removed code for plotting mean ages and put it into a function called `plotMeanAge', which is where it started life. (RH 180416)
    + Removed deprecated function `importCol2'. (RH 180416)
    + Modified function `plotChains' to use `mochaLatte' and moved it from `PBSscape.r' into `plotFuns.r' (RH 180410)
      - Deprecated previous version to `plotChains.lattice'.
    + Switched position of functions `plt.mpdGraphs' and `plt.mcmcGraphs' so that MPD precedes MCMC.
    + Process ongoing to move plotting functions to `plotFuns.r'.
  * plotFuns.r

    + Created new function `plotTraj' to display all median trajectories (base+sens) in one figure. (RH 180504)
    + Fixed bug in `plotSnail' to get the correct coordinate for the final-point cross-bars. (RH 180504)
    + Created a new function `mochaLatte' (mockLattice) to potentially replace the need for lattice plots. (RH 180427)
    + Modified function `plt.exploit' to show gradations warm colours at h=0.05 increments. (RH 180425)
    + Modified function `plt.recdev' to show positive deviations in blue and negative in red. (RH 180425)
    + Modified function `plotAges' (and calls in 'plt.mpdGraps') to better show fitted vs. observed props at age. (RH 180417)
      - Note: scape and lattice functions (e.g., plotCA) are very time-consuming to manipulate; eventually replace them with our own code.
    + Added function `plotMeanAge' which is now called from 'plt.mpdGraps' rather than having plotMeanAge code sitting bare in plt.mpdGraphs. (RH 180416)
    + Sorted potting functions by name in the file.
  * utilFuns.r
    + Created a new function `tex.that.vec' to convert a vector to a phrase 'x, y, and z'. (RH 180507)
      - Superceded by function `texThatVec' in `PBStools' which has been developed further.
  * Sweave (was not updated in last revision even though changes are recorded there)
    + Revised `run-master.Snw'
      - Added new chunk `vicars_and_tarts' to deal with runs where the initial re-weighting was not performed and an MPD was generated as part of a previous MCMC.
      - Sent `ptype' into tracking list object `PBSawatea' in `.PBSmodEnv'.
    + Revised `run-masterMCMC.Snw'
      - Saved `currentProj' later in the code so that it contains projected recruitment.
      - Removed CPUE paramters from the MCMC object `currentMCMC$P'. (RH 180416)
      - Updated method for determining closest catch policy to mean catch.
      - Changed fixed quantile numbers to refer to either `quants3' or `quants5'.
      - Inroduced use of `tex.that.vec' (which evolved into a new function `texThatVec' in PBStools).
      - Tried to reduce the use of the word `percentile'.
    + Wrapped up old Snw files into `ghosts-of-Sweave-past.7z' and deleted them.
      - Yes I know the versioning system keeps track but I'm not taking chances.
      - I'm pretty sure that Hadley is involved somehow...
    + Added my (RH) most recent `resDocSty.sty' file.
      - Yes I know that DFO CSAP has an `official' version, but I prefer to keep control of my beautiful documents.
  * runSweave.r
    + Modified function `runSweave' and `runSweaveMCMC' to pass on the value of `Ncpue' to their respective Sweave files. (RH 180416)
    + Changed number of panels for annual catch-at-age fits from 20 to 25.
    + Introduced the passing of `Ncpue' from the function to the MPD Sweave file.
  * runSweaveMCMC.r
    + Introduced the passing of `Ncpue' from the function to the MCMC Sweave file.
  * runADMB.r
    + Modified function `reweight' to show the sum of deviations of survey/cpue SDNRs from 1. (RH 180411)
  * menuFuns.r
    + Changed all calls to `windows' to a call to `do.call' to pass R check (RH 180523)
      - Functions in this module have never been tested by moi and likely will never be used; think deprecation!

1.2.2 (2018-04-06)
  * PBSscape.r
    + Removed function `plotIndex2' from PBSawatea as it does not seem to be used. (RH 180406)
    + Revised functions `plotIndexNotLattice' to better plot the survey indices. (RH 180406)
    + Revised function `plotCPUE' to use the replacement function `plotCI' and moved it into `plotFuns.r'. (RH 180405)
  * plotFuns.r
    + Created new function `plotCI' to replace `gplots::plotCI'. (RH 180406)
  * Sweave
    + Revised `run-master.Snw' & 'run-masterMCMC.Snw. (RH 180405)
      - Stop creating eps figures if the choice is to use png figures, and vice-versa.
      - Added a new 2-figure function `twofigWH' to add plots with differing heights in the same figure.
      - Added figure tagging through \pdftooltip from the package `pdfcomment'.
      - Changed the BtB0|catchSmall figure to be either eps or png (twas fixed as an eps figure).

1.2.1 (2018-04-04)
  * runSweave.r
    + Save `ptype' in `PBSawatea' list object, which is stored in environment `.PBSmodEnv' via `packList'. (RH 180404)
  * runSweaveMCMC.r
    + Save `ptype' in `PBSawatea' list object, which is stored in environment `.PBSmodEnv' via `packList'. (RH 180404)
  * PBSscape.r
    + Changed arguments `ptypes=c("eps","png")' to `ptypes=tcall(PBSawatea)$ptype' to avoid generating deprecated eps files. (RH 180404)
  * plotFuns.r
    + Changed arguments `ptypes=c("eps","png")' to `ptypes=tcall(PBSawatea)$ptype' to avoid generating deprecated eps files. (RH 180404)
  * Input
    + Added 2017 POP 5ABC model input files. (RH 180404)

1.2.0 (2017-12-04)
  * runADMB.r
    + Revised function `setMethod.reweight' to accept negative cvpro (reduce CV) and fixed cvpro handling for CPUE index series to match that of surveys. (RH 171204)
  * PBSscape.r
    + Modified plotting functions (171201)
      - Standardise quantiles, using global objects `quants3' and `quants5', and pngres=400.

      - Modified `plt.idx', `plt.stdResids', and `plotCPUE' to better accomodate CPUE index series.
      - Modified `plt.stdResids' to better show quantiles in qqnorm plots. (RH 171201)
  * runSweave.r
    + Modified functions in `runSweave' and 'run-master.Snw' (RH 171201)
      - better handle surveys with missing catch-at-age series (surveys no longer need to be ordered by those with c@a first).
  * plotFuns.r
    + Removed function `compBmsy' and added a much-evolved version of this function (same name) to package PBStools. (RH 170908)

      - Added autocorrelation plots using `acf'
    + Modified `run-masterMCMC.Snw' for POP 2017 (RH 170606)
      - Added `ptype' to choose between `eps' and `png' image files.
      - Added `@rmdome' control  flag to remove lines that report dome-shaped selectivity output.
      - Saved `currentRes' to `currentRes.rda'   --  useful to have when compiling the final results appendix.
      - Saved `currentMCMC' to `currentMCMC.rda' --  useful to have when compiling the final results appendix.
      - Saved `currentProj' to `currentProj.rda' --  useful to have when compiling the final results appendix.
      - Saved `currentMSY' to `currentMSY.rda'   --  useful to have when compiling the final results appendix.
      - Disabled copying of MPD figures as code now uses \graphicspath.
      - Added autocorrelation plots using `acf'
      - Added new pairs plot with all parameters on one page (rather than 6 per page)
      - Added new phase (snail) plot to show to show the position of the 2010 assessment point; also changed plot to u_t-1/u_MSY vs. B_t/u_MSY.
  * R code
    + Modified function `runSweaveMCMC.r' for POP 2017 (RH 170607)
      - Added two new arguments -- `ptype' (for plot type eps or png) and `domeS' (logical: use dome-shaped selectivity?)
      - Added switch to use MiKTeX's executable `texify' with ptype=="png".
    + Modified function `runSweaveMCMC.r' for POP 2017 (RH 170607)
      - Added two new arguments -- `ptype' (for plot type eps or png) and `redo.Graphs' (logical: if T rebuild the figure files)
      - Added switch to use MiKTeX's executable `texify' with ptype=="png".
    + Modified function `plotFuns.r' for POP 2017 (RH 170607)
      - Added `redo.Graphs' as an argument to all plot functions.
      - Added new function `plotACFs' using stats::acf function.
    + Modified `PBSscape.r' for POP 2017 (RH 170606)
      - Changed calls to `png' to use arguments units="in" and res=pngres
      - Disabled labelling of cvpro on plots if cvpro==0
      - Added calls to `plotACFs' (autocorrelation plots)
      - Added call to pairs plot with all combos on one page.
      - Modified `plotSnail' (phase plot) to show to show the position of the 2010 assessment point; also changed plot to u_t-1/u_MSY vs. B_t/u_MSY.
    + Modified `runADMB.r' for POP 2017 (RH 170605)
      - Fixed a serious flaw (caught during the POP RPR process by us) in the interpretation of cvpro=0:
      -  code interpreted it as cvpro=FALSE then started adding iterative re-weighting based on old SDNR method.
      - Potential problem still exists if user wants to subtract process error, i.e., cvpro < 0:
      -  squaring in Francis variance formula only assumes that cvpro is added.

1.0.5 (2017-03-28)
  * Sweave
    + Added my `CSAPrefs.bib' file for posterity. (RH 170328)
    + Updated function `runSweave' to allow for removal of lines in `run-master.Snw' not wanted in ResDoc using code `@rmresdoc'. (RH 170328)
    + Re-ordered sequence of plots in `run-master.Snw'. (RH 170328)

1.0.4 (2016-11-30)
  * R code
    + Revised function `runSweave' and `run-master.Snw' to allow plots of observed and estimated proportion-ages for commercial catch-age fits to span multiple pages. (RH 161130)

1.0.3 (2016-11-29)
  * Sweave
    + Added `lattice::' to `trellis.device' in `run-master.Snw' and `run-masterMCMC.Snw' because function is called outside PBSawatea functions. (RH 161129)
  * Documentation
    + Promoted `lattice' in Imports section of DESCRIPTION as `lattice.device' does not seem to be recognised by PBSawatea functions. (RH 161128)
    + Changed backticks ` in DESCRIPTION to single quotes ' (Kurt Hornik 2016-09-20)

1.0.2 (2016-05-19)
  * R code
    + Used `PBSmodelling::view' for setting the method for 'view' when using an AWATEA class. (RH 160519)
    + Removed function `.flush.cat' as it appears in PBStools. (RH 160519)

1.0.1 (2016-05-18)
  * Documentation
    + Cleaned up some more `no visible global function definition' CRANkiness. (RH 160518)
    + Changed DESCRIPTION and NAMESPACE from Imports PBSmodelling to Depends PBStools, which sucks in PBSmodelling and other functionality. (RH 160512)

1.0.0 (2016-04-06)
  * Documentation
    + Updated the vignette `PBSawateaIntro.Rnw'. (RH 160406)
    + Updated `resDocSty.sty' to my current version; added the TDS-compliant uarial fonts `uarial.tds.zip' and the bibliography style file `resDoc.bst'. (RH 160504)
    + Experienced a NAMESPACE epiphany: (RH 160405)
      - In NAMESPACE, package can either be in `import' OR `importFrom', NOT both.
      - But all packages named in `import' AND `importFrom' must appear in DESCRIPTION after `Imports:'.
