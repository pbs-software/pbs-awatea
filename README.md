## PBSawatea: Tools for running Awatea and visualizing the results ##
&copy; Fisheries and Oceans Canada (2011-2025)

<b>PBSawatea</b> provides an R interface for running ADMB Awatea software, which is a variant of the Coleraine fish population software. The added functionality here includes automation of:

1. reweighting abundance data (by weighting survey and commercial index CVs) and composition data (by weighting effective sample sizes <i>N</i> of proportion-at-ages) before choosing an MPD (mode of the posterior distribution) run,
2. launching an MCMC (Monte Carlo Markoff Chain) simulation,
3. calculating <i>B</i><sub>MSY</sub> (biomass at maximum sustainable yield) and <i>u</i><sub>MSY</sub> (exploitation rate at MSY), and
4. customising Sweave files for individual runs and reweightings from various master Sweave files.

The automation offers substantial time-saving when trying numerous model runs.

<b>PBSawatea</b> requires the R packages <b>PBSmodelling</b>, <b>scape</b>, <b>plotMCMC</b>, <b>xtable</b>, <b>lattice</b>, <b>coda</b>, <b>gplots</b>, and <b>Hmisc</b> (all posted on <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/">CRAN</a>).

<b>PBSawatea</b> borrows some functionality from the <b>scape</b> package by adopting the code from a few functions and creating variants. We try to acknowledge the original source wherever possible.

<b>WARNING:</b> The reliance on so many packages is not ideal because each relies on other packages (e.g., Frank Harrell's <b>Hmisc</b> taps into a cascade of dependencies that rivals the machinations of Wizard Wickham). This means that a user likely has to install various additional R packages, which is a nuisance. Below you can see this maze of cross-dependencies in the <b>scape</b> package. Given enough time, we could extract ourselves from this morass by designing our own functions; however, extrication is slow.

<b>PBSawatea</b> depends on and imports <b>PBSmodelling</b>. Additionally <b>PBSawatea</b> imports the following packages:

<b>methods</b>, <b>lattice</b>, <b>scape</b>, <b>plotMCMC</b>, and <b>xtable</b>.

<b>PBSawatea</b> imports specific functions from the following:

import(methods, PBSmodelling, lattice, scape, plotMCMC, xtable)

importFrom("graphics", "abline", "arrows", "axis", "barplot", "box", "boxplot", "contour", "frame", "legend", "lines", "mtext", "pairs", "par", "plot", "points", "polygon", "rect", "segments", "text")

importFrom("grDevices", "boxplot.stats", "colorRampPalette", "dev.cur", "dev.list", "dev.off", "extendrange", "pdf", "png", "postscript", "savePlot", "win.metafile", "windows")

importFrom("Hmisc", "Cbind", "panel.xYplot")

importFrom("stats", "acf", "cor", "fitted", "lowess", "median", "na.pass", "qqnorm", "quantile", "residuals", "rnorm", "runif", "sd", "smooth.spline", "var")

importFrom("utils", "Sweave", "data", "flush.console", "help", "installed.packages", "menu", "read.table", "tail", "write.table")

importFrom("akima", "interp")

importFrom("PBStools", "changeLangOpts", "eop", ".flush.cat", "findRC", "inWord", ".su", "scaleVec")

In the end, the target audience is very small, comprising only those people who actually use Awatea. The platform was last used in 2024 for an update of the model used in the 2019 Bocaccio stock assessment, primarliy to follow up on the huge 2016 recruitment event. 

<b>PBSawatea</b> is not available on <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">CRAN</a> (Comprehensive R Archive Network); however, the source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/pbs-software/pbs-awatea">GitHub</a>. Most versions undergo a CRAN-like check, via `R CMD check` on a <b>Windows</b> 64-bit system. The package has fallen out of use because the Offshore Rockfish Program switched to using Stock Synthesis 3 in 2021 (see <a href="https://github.com/pbs-software/pbs-synth">PBSsynth</a>). Regardless, the best way to use this code is to source it directly when performing stock assessments, so think of the repo as a depot.
